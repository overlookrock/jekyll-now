Dewey Decimal Classification System.

First question that I have had when planning the blog, is how we can classify the data analysis that I will do. We can find data on Sports, Culture, Economics,... 

Initially, Trivial Pursuit classification came into my mind:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="./images/Trivialpursuit_Token.jpg" /></div>

* Geography
* Entertainment
* History
* Arts & Literature
* Science & Nature
* Sports & Leisure



However, other classifications exists. We need to consideer that the volume of data available for analysis has increase during last years, but classification is not a new, and probably was still more required on the past, when searching was not as easy as press CTRL+F.
