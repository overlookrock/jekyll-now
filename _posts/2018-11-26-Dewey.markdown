Dewey Decimal Classification System.

First question that I have had when planning the blog, is how we can classify the data analysis that I will do. We can find data on Sports, Culture, Economics,... 

Initially, Trivial Pursuit classification came into my mind:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="./images/Trivialpursuit_Token.jpg" /></div>

* Geography
* Entertainment
* History
* Arts & Literature
* Science & Nature
* Sports & Leisure



However, other classifications exists. We need to consideer that the volume of data available for analysis has increase during last years, but classification is not a new, and probably was still more required on the past, when searching was not as easy as press CTRL+F.

On 1876, Melvil Dewey, an american librarian, publish an article explaining their classification system after several years of development (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12513/12513-h/12513-h.htm) , the categories that he suggest on the articles were:


|Number | Area |
|:-------:|------|
|000 | Computer science, information & general works |
|100 | Philosophy & psychology |
|200 | Religion |
|300 | Social sciences |
|400 | Language |
|500 | Pure Science |
|600 | Technology |
|700 | Arts & recreation |
|800 | Literature |
|900 | History & geography |


This is only the first level of divisions, because each of this divisions, grow as a tree, including other sub-division, with different reference numbers.
Maybe use, at least the first level of divisions of the DDC (Dewey Decimal Classification) as reference to find and analyse data from different areas could be a good idea.
